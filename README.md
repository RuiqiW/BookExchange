# A Textbook Exchange Web Application
## Overview
The purpose of our website is to create an open platform that allows students to resell and purchase used textbooks and other school accessories. Reselling is definitely beneficial because it saves money for both the seller and the buyer, but sometimes itâ€™s difficult to match the supply and demand of a specific used item. Our website helps students to easily find thosed used school supplies and contact with sellers/buyers.
